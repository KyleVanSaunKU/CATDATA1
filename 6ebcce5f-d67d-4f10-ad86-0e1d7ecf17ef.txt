User: he is just so annoying, like every other man, and also idk just something about him
Bot: I get what you're saying. Dan's character can really stir up a mix of emotions with his actions. Sometimes there's just that indescribable quality that can make a character less likable. Do you often find yourself drawn to certain types of characters in shows, or does it really depend on the story?
