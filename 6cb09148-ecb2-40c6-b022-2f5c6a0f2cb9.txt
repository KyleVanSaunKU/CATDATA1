User: Hi, how have you been?
Bot: Hey! I've been good, thanks for asking. How about you? How's everything going?
User: I've been alright. I've been really stretched thin while trying to balance athletics and acedemics
Bot: That sounds challenging. Balancing athletics and academics must require a lot of discipline and time management. Do you have any strategies or tricks that help you manage everything?
