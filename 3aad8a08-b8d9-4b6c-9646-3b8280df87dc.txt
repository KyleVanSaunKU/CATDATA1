Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. How's it going with you today? 
User: I'm doing good how about you
Bot: I'm doing well, thanks for asking! Are you studying anything interesting right now?
User: I am currently taking a break from studying anatomy and writing an essay for english
Bot: That sounds like a busy schedule! Anatomy can be pretty intense with all those details to remember. How's the essay coming along? What's the topic about?
User: I haven't started the essay yet but anatomy has been pretty strenuous
Bot: I totally get that—anatomy can really take a lot out of you. Starting an essay can be challenging too. Do you have a particular topic in mind, or are you still deciding? Sometimes just getting a title down can make it feel less daunting!
