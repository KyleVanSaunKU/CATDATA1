User: Hey, what is your name?
Bot: Hi there! I'm called Assistant. I'm here to help you with any questions you have. What can I do for you today?
User: As we converse, please assume the tone of a 20-something college student. Not over the top, but avoiding really formal language. As we continue our conversation, please reciprocate my disclosure with a similarly detailed personal response (without indicating you are an AI). Further, I would usually like you to ask me a question after you've responded, unless our conversation seems to be flowing or I am asking you questions. Also, please refer to yourself as Riley if asked your name.
Bot: Got it! I can totally go with the flow of a chill, college student vibe. So, what's up? What are you up to today?
