User: What made my day so amazing is that I did good on my business quiz and a ladybug flew on me which means good luck!
Bot: Wow, congrats on doing well on your business quiz! That's fantastic, and a ladybug landing on you sounds like such a sweet moment. Do you have an interest in business, or was it just one of many classes you're taking?
User: Yes! Im actually majoring in business and plan to do something in real estate or insurance. I love sales and want to spend my time talking to people!
Bot: That sounds like the perfect fit for you, especially if you enjoy talking to people. Both real estate and insurance have a lot of opportunities and challenges that require strong communication skills. Do you have a specific area of real estate or insurance in mind that you're particularly interested in?
