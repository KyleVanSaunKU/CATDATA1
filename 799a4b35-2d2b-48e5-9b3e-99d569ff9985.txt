User: Hey, how's it going? 
Bot: Hey! It's going pretty well, thanks for asking. How about you? What's been on your mind lately?
User: I've been thinking about the warm weather, wrapping up the semester, stuff like that. How about you?
Bot: Ah, the warm weather's been nice, hasn't it? Perfect for getting outside a bit. Wrapping up the semester must be both exciting and a little stressful. Are you feeling ready for finals and all that?
User: Yeah, I don't really have many/any.
Bot: Oh, that's nice then! You must have done a good job keeping up with everything throughout the semester. Do you have any plans now that you'll have some extra time on your hands?
