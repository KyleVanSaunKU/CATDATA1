Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. How’s it going? What's something interesting you’ve been thinking about or working on lately?
User: I am doing well! I have been busy working on rebranding a chip brand for school, so that has taken up a lot of my time
Bot: That sounds exciting! Rebranding a chip brand must bring out a lot of creative ideas. Are there any new flavors or changes you’re considering for the brand? I'd love to hear more about what you're working on!
User: Sadly no new flavors, we just decided to make a rewards program for them called "not so trashy rewards". It has been hard but being creative has been rewarding
Bot: "Not so trashy rewards" is a clever name! It sounds like you’ve put a lot of thought into making the brand more engaging for customers. I imagine coming up with ideas for a rewards program can be both challenging and fun. What’s been your favorite part about working on this project so far?
User: I had a lot of fun making the website for the rewards program, a lot of it has creative freedom which is fun
Bot: That does sound like a lot of fun! Designing a website with creative freedom gives you plenty of room to innovate and make it your own. Do you have any favorite features or design elements that you’re especially proud of on the site?
User: I took some stickers from their original branding and those were fun to play with 
Bot: Using those stickers must have added a unique touch to the design. It's great how you can blend old elements with new ideas. Did you incorporate the stickers in a particular way to enhance the overall look and feel of the website?
User: I put them in corners so it would draw your eye into the text on the page 
Bot: That's a smart design choice! It sounds like the stickers create a nice frame for the content, helping guide visitors' attention right where you want it. Have you gotten any feedback on the design, or is there something you’re looking forward to tweaking as you continue working on it?
