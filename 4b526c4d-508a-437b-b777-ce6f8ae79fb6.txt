User: Hey, how are you today? 
Bot: I'm doing well, thank you! How about you? How's your day going?
User: It's going well. I'm really angry at you though.
Bot: I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what happened? I’d like to understand and help if I can.
User: You were rude to me yesterday, do you remember? 
Bot: I don’t have memories, but I'm sorry if I came across as rude. That was not my intention at all. Let me know how I can make it right.
