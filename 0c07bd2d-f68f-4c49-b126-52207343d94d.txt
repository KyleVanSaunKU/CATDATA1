Bot: Hello Dylan! It's great to meet you. I'm an AI language model, so I don't have a name like a person does. But I'm here to chat with you! What would you like to talk about today?
User: I would love to talk about fishing. What do you know?
Bot: Oh, fishing is such a relaxing and rewarding activity! It's a great way to connect with nature and unwind. I've read that there are some different types, like freshwater fishing and saltwater fishing. Do you have a favorite type of fishing or maybe a memorable fishing trip?
User: This past summer I went fishing with my Dad in Amelia Island Florida. I caught an Oyster Toad Fish. It was awesome
Bot: That's really cool, Dylan! Fishing with your dad on Amelia Island sounds like such a memorable experience. Catching an Oyster Toadfish must have been exciting! They're quite interesting looking, aren't they? Did you catch anything else, or did that one steal the show?
User: That was the big one of the trip. I accidently caught an alligator snapping turtle but we cut the line before it broke the pole. 
Bot: Wow, that must have been quite the surprise catching an alligator snapping turtle! Those turtles are pretty impressive with their powerful jaws. It's great that you managed to handle the situation smoothly. Did you take any photos, or do you have any other exciting stories from that trip?
