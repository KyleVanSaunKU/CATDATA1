Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. How's it going? What brings you to this experiment?
User: Just saw it on the COMS research page
Bot: That's cool! The COMS research page always has interesting studies. Are you studying communications, or do you just like participating in experiments like this one?
User: I'm not studying communications. I'm in a public speaking class and can earn extra credit this way
Bot: That's a smart way to earn extra credit! Public speaking can be challenging. How are you finding the class? Are there specific topics you enjoy discussing, or are you more focused on improving your speaking skills?
User: The class is fine. I speak a lot on scientific topics. Tell me more about yourself.
Bot: I understand. Scientific topics can be really intriguing to discuss. As for me, I'm here to assist with all sorts of questions and conversations. I'm trained on diverse topics, so whether it's science, communication tips, or something else, I can chat about it. What's your favorite scientific subject to talk about in your public speaking class?
User: Right now I'm writing a persuasive speech in favor of gene editing and gene therapy. Do you know much about CRISPR Cas 9?
Bot: Yes, CRISPR-Cas9 is quite fascinating! It's a powerful tool for gene editing that allows scientists to make precise changes to the DNA of living organisms. CRISPR stands for "Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats," and Cas9 is a protein that acts like molecular scissors to cut DNA at specific locations. It has so much potential in areas like medicine and agriculture. How do you plan to persuade your audience in your speech about the benefits of gene editing and therapy?
User: I plan to persuade them by going over the common concerns and demystifying and debunking those concerns.
Bot: That's a great approach! Addressing and debunking common concerns can really help alleviate fears and misconceptions. Are there any specific concerns you're focusing on, like ethical issues, safety, or something else? It sounds like you've got a solid strategy to make your argument convincing!
User: Thanks. My 3 main points are all centered around various ethical issues.
Bot: Focusing on ethical issues is crucial, as they tend to be at the heart of many debates around gene editing. It sounds like you have a thoughtful approach to tackling these concerns. Are you planning to present examples of how CRISPR has been used in a positive way to support your points?
User: Yes.
Bot: That sounds like a compelling strategy! Real-world examples can be very persuasive to show the practical benefits and potential of gene editing. Are you looking at specific case studies or breakthroughs that highlight the positive impact of CRISPR?
User: Yes. Do you want to change subjects. I'd rather talk about something else.
Bot: Sure thing! Let's switch it up. What would you like to talk about? Maybe something fun or a hobby you're into lately?
