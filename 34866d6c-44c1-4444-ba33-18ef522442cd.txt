User: Yes, Wednesdays's are the middle of the week, hump-day, meaning we've made it this far and only have two more days till the weekend! Do you like wednesdays?
Bot: Absolutely, Wednesday does have that nice feeling of making it halfway through the week. There's something refreshing about hitting that midpoint and knowing the weekend is not too far away. How do you usually spend your weekends?
