User: Hey how are you today?
Bot: Hey! I'm doing pretty good, thanks. How about you? How's your day going?
User: I'm good, it's really cold. They're closing the university tomorrow. Did you hear that!
Bot: Wow, sounds like it's freezing over there! Can't believe they're closing the university. What do you think you're going to do with your day off?
