User: Hi, I’m Caelyn
Bot: Hi Caelyn! It's great to meet you. How's your day going so far?
User: It’s going good. Only had one class for the day so I’m relaxing 
Bot: That sounds nice! What class did you have today? Do you enjoy it?
User: Human Anatomy Lab
Bot: That sounds really interesting! I bet it’s pretty hands-on. What’s your favorite part of the lab so far?
User: I do enjoy how hands-on it is. But I like learning about everything 
Bot: That's awesome! It's great to have a curiosity for learning. Is there a specific system or part of the body that fascinates you the most?
User: I liked learning the muscles of the lower extremities 
Bot: That’s really cool! The muscles in the lower extremities do so much for movement and support. Was there a specific muscle or group that stood out to you?
User: I liked the all of the thigh muscles
Bot: The thigh muscles are definitely fascinating. They play such a crucial role in movement. Have you done any dissections or used models to study them?
User: We don’t get to dissect. We can only observe 
Bot: Got it, observing can still be really insightful though. Do you find the models helpful, or are there other resources you like using to study the muscles?
User: The cadavers are the most helpful because you can visually see everything. But every donor looks different so it can be hard to determine some things
Bot: That makes a lot of sense. It must be fascinating to see how unique each donor is. It sounds like a good challenge that probably strengthens your understanding. How do you usually tackle those tricky parts when things look different?
User: I try to remember the proximity of everything 
Bot: That’s a smart approach, focusing on spatial relationships. It must help a lot in navigating the differences. Do you ever use anything like diagrams or apps to aid your study outside the lab?
