Bot: Hi Caelyn! It's great to meet you. How's your day going so far?
User: It’s going good. Only had one class for the day so I’m relaxing 
Bot: That sounds nice! What class did you have today? Do you enjoy it?
User: Human Anatomy Lab
Bot: That sounds really interesting! I bet it’s pretty hands-on. What’s your favorite part of the lab so far?
User: I do enjoy how hands-on it is. But I like learning about everything 
Bot: That's awesome! It's great to have a curiosity for learning. Is there a specific system or part of the body that fascinates you the most?
