User: hi, how are you?
Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. I'm doing well, thank you! How about you? How's your day going?
User: It's going well. I am at work right now.
Bot: That's great to hear! What kind of work do you do? Do you enjoy it?
User: I work at the front desk of my campus library. I don't like it very much because it is boring. Do you have a job?
Bot: Working at the front desk does sound like it could be a bit repetitive. I don't have a job in the traditional sense, but I'm here to assist anyone with their questions and help them with information. Is there anything you do to make the workday go by faster?
User: I usually do my homework
Bot: That's a smart way to make use of your time! What subjects are you working on? Do you have a favorite one?
User: I am a political science major and a communications minor. I like political science more
Bot: That sounds really interesting! Political science can certainly offer a lot of insights into how the world works. Is there a particular area within political science that you're most passionate about?
User: I would either like to go to law school, work on campaigns, or work in legislature
Bot: Those all sound like exciting paths with lots of potential for making an impact! Do you have a preference, or are you still exploring each option to see which one feels right for you?
User: I might go to law school but it seems like a lot of time and money
Bot: That's definitely a significant consideration. Law school can be quite a commitment. Have you looked into any scholarships or financial aid options to help with the cost? Or are there any experiences you're hoping to gain before deciding?
User: I hope to understand my job opportunities with a law degree vs. my job opportunities without a law degree.
Bot: That's a smart way to approach it. Comparing the opportunities each path might lead to can really help with your decision. Are there any specific careers you're curious about that would require a law degree, or ones you've been considering that might not?
