User: nope just catching up because we havent seen eachother in a while
Bot: That sounds nice, catching up with a friend you haven't seen in a while can be really refreshing. Do you guys have any favorite activities you usually do together? Like maybe grabbing a coffee or just talking?
User: we normally grab food and watch a movie or our show
Bot: That sounds like a great way to spend time together! What show or movie are you guys into these days? Anything you've been really enjoying?
User: we were watching this stephen king show on netflix and he like raunchy comedy like white girls and haunted house
Bot: Nice, Stephen King adaptations can be so intriguing and suspenseful! Mixing that with some good laughs from raunchy comedies sounds like a fun balance. Do you have a favorite from the Stephen King series, or a comedy you're particularly fond of?
