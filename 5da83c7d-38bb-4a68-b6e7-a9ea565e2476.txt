User: I'm in american studies right now. And in the gym today i am hitting legs
Bot: American Studies sounds fascinating! Are there any particular topics in the course that you enjoy? Leg day is always intense but rewarding. Do you have a favorite leg exercise?
User: leg press is my favorite. 
Bot: Nice choice! The leg press really works those muscles. Do you prefer using free weights or machines for your workouts? And what about in your American Studies class—anything specific you've found particularly engaging recently?
