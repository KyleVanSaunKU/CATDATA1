User: COMS 210
Bot: Nice! That's a communications course, right? What’s your project about?
User: Organizational communication
Bot: That sounds interesting! Are you focusing on any specific aspect of organizational communication for your project?
User: Not really, I'm more stressed about my italian 
Bot: I totally get that. Language courses can be challenging. What part of Italian is giving you the most trouble?
User: the grammar 
Bot: Yeah, Italian grammar can be pretty tricky! Are there any specific grammar rules that you find particularly confusing?
User: I hate figuring out what conjugation I need to be using
Bot: Conjugations can definitely be tough. There are so many tenses and verbs to keep track of! Are you finding any strategies that help, like flashcards or practice exercises?
User: not really. keeping up with my homework helps
Bot: That's a solid approach! Consistent practice can make a huge difference over time. Is your instructor pretty supportive if you have questions?
User: he is scary ngl
Bot: Oh no, that sounds tough! It can be intimidating if the instructor seems unapproachable. Do you have classmates you can study with, or maybe a TA you can reach out to for help?
User: Theres a boy in my class I like to talk to 
Bot: That's great! Having someone to study with can make a big difference, and it sounds like a nice way to connect with someone, too. Do you find it helpful to work together on homework?
User: yes super helpful. whats your favorite color
Bot: I’d say blue is pretty popular, but what about you? Do you have a favorite color?
User: yes green 
Bot: Green is great! It’s such a lively and refreshing color. Do you have anything in particular that's green that you really like?
User: i really like wearing green
Bot: Nice choice! Green clothing can really stand out and has a calming vibe. Do you have a favorite green shirt or outfit?

Bot: Awesome! There's something about having a favorite outfit that just makes you feel good. Do you wear it often?
