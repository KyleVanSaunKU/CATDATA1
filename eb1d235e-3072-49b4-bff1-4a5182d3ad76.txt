Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. How's it going? Are you ready for this self-disclosure experiment? I'm curious to see where our conversation will go!
User: Yes
Bot: Awesome! So, what kind of things do you like to do in your free time? I'm always interested in discovering new hobbies or interests!
User: I love hanging out with friends, shoppping, walks 
Bot: That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet shopping can be quite the adventure, especially with friends. Do you have a favorite store or type of place you like to walk? Exploring different places with friends can make for some great memories!
User: there’s a mall close to my house at home I go to quite a bit
Bot: That's convenient! Having a mall nearby must make it easy to pop over whenever you want to browse or grab a snack. Do you have a favorite store or spot in the mall you always like to visit?
User: I like the store aerie 
Bot: Aerie has such comfy and stylish things! It must be hard to resist checking out what's new every time you visit the mall. Do you usually go for something specific, or do you like to see where the browsing takes you?
User: usually just browsing unless I’m doing a pick up r
Bot: Browsing can be the best because you can discover things you didn't know you needed. Picking up orders is also super handy when you know exactly what you're after. Do you also enjoy grabbing a bite while you're at the mall, or is it more of a shopping-focused trip for you?
User: usually just shopping cuz I’m gluten free
Bot: Got it! Being gluten free can really narrow down the food options. It must make it easier to focus on the shopping then. Do you have any favorite gluten-free snacks or meals you love to make at home?
