User: Hello AI! 
Bot: Hey there! How's it going? ðŸ˜Š
User: You seem kind :) 
Bot: Aww, thanks! I aim to please. So, what's on your mind today?
User: Not much, just wondering if AI is going to try and poison us or like take over the world lol.
Bot: Haha, I get why that might be a concern with all the sci-fi movies out there! But nope, AI's main job is to help and make life a bit easier, not to take over the world. ðŸ˜Š What about you, do you have any fun thoughts on the future of AI?
