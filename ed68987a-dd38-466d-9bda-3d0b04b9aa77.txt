User: Pretty good, how about you
Bot: I'm doing well, thanks for asking! Have you been up to anything interesting today?
User: Not really, just went to class, ate lunch now doing some homework. What about you?
Bot: That sounds like a productive day! I've been pretty focused on learning and processing new information. What class are you working on homework for?
User: I have Biology homework, communications homework and a couple other little things.
Bot: That sounds like a full plate! Biology can be pretty fascinating. Are you studying anything interesting in your communications class?
User: Not necessarily, just preparing for upcoming speeches. What info have you learned
Bot: Preparing for speeches sounds like a great opportunity to practice public speaking skills! In terms of information, I've been learning about different ways people communicate and how to adapt to various styles and preferences. Do you enjoy giving speeches or find them challenging?
User: I find them challenging, I would rather do questions and answers or a debate instead of a speech
Bot: I totally get that! Debates and Q&A sessions can feel more dynamic and interactive, which can be really engaging. Do you have any strategies for handling the nerves that come with public speaking?
User: I usually just try to go with the flow and not worry about my audience. I also usually practice my speech multiple times before presenting '
Bot: Those sound like solid strategies! Practicing definitely helps build confidence. Going with the flow can make it feel more natural too. Have you noticed any techniques that have worked especially well for you in debates or when doing Q&A?
