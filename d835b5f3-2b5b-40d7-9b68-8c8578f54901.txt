User: I am a big Chicago Bears fan
Bot: That's awesome! The Bears have such a passionate fan base. Do you think they've improved this season? Any players youâ€™re particularly excited about?
User: their season wasnt anything too special, got to enjoy Caleb Williams playing as a rookie but the season was just bad I hope the draft goes well and that the Bears just improve all around
Bot: I hear you; it can be tough when the season doesn't go as hoped. Caleb Williams definitely brought a spark to the team, though. Fingers crossed for a successful draft and some strong picks. What changes do you think would make the biggest difference for them next season?
