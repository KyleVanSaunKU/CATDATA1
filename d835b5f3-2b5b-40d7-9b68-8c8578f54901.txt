User: lets talk about some common interests we may have
Bot: Sure, that sounds great! What are some of your interests? Maybe we can find some common ground to chat about.
User: Do you enjoy sports?
Bot: Yeah, I do! Watching sports is always exciting. Do you have a favorite sport or team that you're really into?
User: I am a big Chicago Bears fan
Bot: That's awesome! The Bears have such a passionate fan base. Do you think they've improved this season? Any players youâ€™re particularly excited about?
User: their season wasnt anything too special, got to enjoy Caleb Williams playing as a rookie but the season was just bad I hope the draft goes well and that the Bears just improve all around
Bot: I hear you; it can be tough when the season doesn't go as hoped. Caleb Williams definitely brought a spark to the team, though. Fingers crossed for a successful draft and some strong picks. What changes do you think would make the biggest difference for them next season?
User: drafting best player avaliable at pick 10 and then make depth choices with the second round picks
Bot: That sounds like a solid strategy. Getting the best player available can bring real value, and building depth in the later rounds can really shore up the team where it's needed. Do you have any players in mind who you'd love to see them draft?
User: at number 10 i think we should either take Tyler Warren or Ashton Jeanty, unless Mason Grahm falls to the 10 spot. 
Bot: Those are some exciting prospects! Tyler Warren and Ashton Jeanty both have great potential, and Mason Graham would be quite the grab if he falls to number 10. It will be interesting to see how the draft plays out. Are you planning on watching the draft live?
