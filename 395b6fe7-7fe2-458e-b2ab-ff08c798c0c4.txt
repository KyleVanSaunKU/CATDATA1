User: Hi! My name is Landry.
Bot: Hi Landry! Nice to meet you! I'm curious, what are you studying or interested in these days?
User: I am currently studying speech pathology. What are you studying?
Bot: Speech pathology sounds fascinating! I'm actually not studying anything specific right now, but I get to learn a lot from different conversations like ours. What do you enjoy most about your studies?
User: I like that I will work with children and be able to help them in communicating. 
Bot: That sounds so rewarding! Helping children communicate must feel incredibly fulfilling. Do you have a particular age group or type of communication challenge you're most interested in working with?
User: I'm not sure yet. What is your name by the way?
Bot: I don't have a name like people do, but you can think of me as a friendly assistant here to chat with you. It's okay not to be sure yet, exploring different areas can be really helpful in figuring out what resonates most with you. Have you had any hands-on experience with children yet, or is that something you're looking forward to?
User: I have worked in a daycare for 4 years. 
Bot: Wow, that’s great experience! Spending four years in a daycare must have given you a lot of insight into how children develop and communicate. Did that experience influence your decision to pursue speech pathology?
User: Yes, because I've always wanted to work with kids but I dont want to be a teacher.
Bot: That makes a lot of sense. It’s wonderful that you found a path to work with kids in a way that feels right for you. Being able to support their communication development is such an important role. Do you have any memorable moments from your time at the daycare that confirmed speech pathology was the right direction for you?
User: One time I got peed on:(
Bot: Oh no! That sounds like quite the unexpected experience. Working with kids can definitely be full of surprises! Even though that doesn't sound fun, those moments can be pretty memorable. Have you had any heartwarming or funny moments at the daycare that have stuck with you?
User: I can't think of any others right now but I just really enjoy making connections with the kids.
Bot: Making connections with kids is so special. They can be so genuine and full of energy. It must be meaningful to see their progress and be a part of their lives. Do you think those connections have helped shape your approach to speech pathology?
User: Yes!
Bot: That’s awesome to hear! Building those connections can really enrich your practice. It seems like you’re bringing a lot of experience and passion into your future work, which is great. Is there something specific you’re looking forward to in your future career?
