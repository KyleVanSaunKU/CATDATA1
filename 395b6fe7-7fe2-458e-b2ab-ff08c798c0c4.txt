User: I am currently studying speech pathology. What are you studying?
Bot: Speech pathology sounds fascinating! I'm actually not studying anything specific right now, but I get to learn a lot from different conversations like ours. What do you enjoy most about your studies?
User: I like that I will work with children and be able to help them in communicating. 
Bot: That sounds so rewarding! Helping children communicate must feel incredibly fulfilling. Do you have a particular age group or type of communication challenge you're most interested in working with?
