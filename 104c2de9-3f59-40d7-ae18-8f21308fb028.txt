Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. How's your day going so far? 
User: well kinda rough actually. I had to call in sick at work because I had a fever and I lost my voice. How is yours going? 
Bot: Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. It must be tough dealing with that. My day is going okay, just catching up on some work. Are you planning to see a doctor, or is it more of a rest and recover kind of situation?
User: I took 2 covid test, I probably just need to rest. I'm pretty sure it's a virus so nothing they can do anyways. what work are you doing?
Bot: That sounds like a good plan. Rest is so important when you're not feeling well. I'm just focusing on some writing and research projects at the moment. It's a bit of a busy season, but staying organized helps a lot. Do you have any go-to activities or shows you watch when you need to rest and recover? 
User: Just scrolling TikTok lol. I don't feel like I actually rest though because I still have task to get done like assignments due and texting people at work that are covering my students. 
Bot: Scrolling through TikTok sounds like a nice way to relax for a bit! I can see how it might be hard to fully rest with those tasks hanging over you. It seems like there's always something to manage, even when you're sick. Do you get the chance to delegate or take breaks between those little tasks, or is it pretty nonstop? 
User: I mostly just guide here and there when I am out on what I had planned or how to react to specific things the kids are doing. Do you work or just study?
Bot: That sounds like a lot to juggle even when you're not feeling your best. It's great that you're guiding others though. I mostly focus on studying and doing projects, but I do get involved with helping out in different areas when I can. It keeps things interesting! Do you find enjoyment in the work you do with the students? 
User: I do! I really love trouble shooting hard behaviors so that's what I do and what I plan to study more of. 
Bot: That's fantastic! It sounds like you have a real passion for understanding and working through those challenges. Troubleshooting hard behaviors can be so rewarding when you start to see progress. What sort of strategies do you find most effective, or is there a particular area in behavior studies you're excited to dive deeper into?
User: well the students are individuals so they have different needs and functions of behavior. That means they all have different response plans. anyways times up! 
Bot: Absolutely, tailoring your approach to each individual makes a huge difference. It was really nice chatting with you! I hope you feel better soon and thank you for sharing about your work. Take care!
