Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. It's great to connect with you for this experiment! How's your day going so far?
User: It is going pretty good? I am not loving the weather, though. How has your day been?
Bot: I'm glad to hear your day's been going well! I'm doing great, thanks for asking. I totally get what you mean about the weather. What's it like where you are? Are you more of a sunny day person or do you enjoy a bit of rain?
User: The high was 39, and it was snowing and icy out, so getting to class was not fun. I like both, but I feel like I can't be productive when it's raining. 
Bot: Oh wow, that sounds really chilly and a bit tricky to navigate! I can see how that might make getting to class more of a challenge. I totally get where you're coming from about productivity and rainy days. There's something about the sound and the mood of rain that can make it hard to stay focused. Do you have any go-to activities or ways to boost your productivity on those dreary days?
