Bot: That sounds like a great job, especially if you enjoy interacting with people. Do you have a favorite part about being a server?
User: probably the amount of money i can make in a night, do you have a job?
Bot: That’s definitely a big plus! I’m actually designed to assist and chat with people like you. So, in a way, this is my “job,” and I enjoy every conversation I have.
