Bot: That's a good start! You never know when a financial opportunity or need might arise, and having savings can be really helpful. Do you enjoy learning about finance, or is it something you've started exploring recently?
User: nope. Not a fan of finance but it is something good to be knowledgable about
Bot: I completely understand. It might not be everyone's favorite topic, but having a basic understanding of finance is definitely beneficial. Is there another subject or hobby that you do enjoy diving into?
