User: I am doing fine. How are you doing today?
Bot: I'm doing well, thank you for asking! Are you excited about anything specific today or have any plans?
User: Today is actually a busy day for me. I have a lot of classes. Than after that I have study hours. Then after study hours I need to apply for a job and go to volunteer. After volunteering I have an event at night 9 pm. What are your plans for today
Bot: Wow, you've got quite a packed schedule today! It sounds like a productive day filled with learning and giving back, especially with volunteering. As for me, I'll be here, ready to chat whenever you need a study break or just want to share how things are going. What's the event you’ll be attending at 9 pm?
User: Something for a friend
Bot: That sounds nice! Supporting a friend is always a great thing to do. Is it a celebration of some sort, or maybe a casual get-together? Those moments can be really special.
User: A celebration of some sort 
Bot: That sounds exciting! Celebrations often bring a lot of joy and good memories. Do you have any particular role in the event, or are you just going to relax and enjoy the occasion?
User: Nothing much lets change the topic!
Bot: Sure thing! What would you like to talk about? Any recent hobbies, books, or shows you've been into lately?
User: I have honestly been so busy since coming to college I do not really have many hobbies but I really enjoy spending time volunteering as well as just spending my free time with friends around me
Bot: That's really wonderful! Volunteering can be such a rewarding experience, and spending time with friends is a great way to unwind and create lasting memories. Do you have a favorite volunteering experience or something you and your friends love to do together?
User: I really enjoy working with kids when I volunteer. In the future I want to work with kids so this is a good way to get exposure and experience working with children. 
Bot: That's amazing! Working with kids can be so fulfilling, and it's great that you're already building experience in that area. Do you have a specific career path in mind where you'd like to work with children, like teaching or child psychology, perhaps?
User: I really want to be a speech pathologist and work on the pedeatric side of it!
Bot: That sounds like a truly impactful career choice! Helping kids find their voices and improve their communication skills can make such a difference in their lives. What inspired you to pursue speech pathology, especially focusing on pediatrics?
