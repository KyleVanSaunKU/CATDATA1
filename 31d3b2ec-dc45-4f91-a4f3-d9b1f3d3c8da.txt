Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. It's great to connect with you! How's your day going so far? Anything exciting happening today?
User: My day is going pretty well so far. Nothing special really, I was supposed to give a speech in my COMS class. How was yours?
Bot: That sounds like an important day for you! I hope the preparation has been going smoothly for your speech. My day has been quite nice, thank you. What’s the topic of your speech, if you don’t mind sharing?
User: Thank you! It's about names and what significance they serve in social interactions that we may not be aware of.
Bot: Wow, that sounds fascinating! Names can definitely carry a lot of meaning and influence our interactions in subtle ways. Did you discover anything surprising or particularly interesting while researching for your speech?
User: I learned that people named Dennis and Denise are statistically more likely to become Dentists and that women named Georgia are more geographically incline to live in Georgia. Did you know or notice any of these things before?
Bot: That's really intriguing! I hadn't come across those specific findings before, but it does make you wonder about the power of names and their influence on our choices. The idea of "nominative determinism," where people's names can influence their career paths, is such a cool topic. How did you feel coming across this research? Does it change the way you think about names?
User: Not necessarily I think this is an idea a lot of people interact with but never consciously acknowledge 
Bot: That's a good point. It’s like an underlying pattern that people might not always notice. It’s amazing how much influence something as simple as a name can have without us being fully aware of it. Are there any specific insights or ideas from your research you're looking forward to sharing in your class?
User: I kept my research very surface level but one thing that I think my class may be interested in is also that various spellings of the same name can also illicit different assumptions of people
Bot: That's definitely an interesting angle! It's amazing how just a slight variation in spelling can lead to different perceptions about a person. It's something people might not think about often, but it could really play a role in first impressions. Do you have any examples or personal experiences with this that you'll be sharing with your class?
