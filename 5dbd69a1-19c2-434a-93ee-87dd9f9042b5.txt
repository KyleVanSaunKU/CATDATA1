Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. How are you today? What are you looking forward to in this experiment?
User: I’m good! how are you? I am looking forward to getting to know you today! What about you?
Bot: I'm doing great, thanks for asking! I'm really excited to get to know you too and see where our conversation takes us. Have you done anything like this before?
User: I have not! How many times have you?
Bot: This is my first time too, so we’re in this together! It's kind of exciting to try something new, don’t you think? What are some things you enjoy doing in your free time?
User: I love trying new things as well! In my free time I enjoy going on hikes or walks, getting coffee with my friends, or hanging out with my sorority sisters!! What about you?
Bot: That sounds awesome! I love the idea of exploring nature on hikes and spending quality time with friends over coffee. For me, I enjoy diving into new tech projects, reading up on the latest trends, and having good conversations just like this one! Do you have a favorite hike or coffee spot?
User: My favorite coffee spot is from my hometown of St. Louis Missouri! It’s called Orange couch!
Bot: Orange Couch sounds like a cozy place! It must be nice to have such a special spot in your hometown. What's your go-to order when you visit there?
User: My go to order is a cinnamon bun latte! It’s SOO good! Do you like coffee?
Bot: A cinnamon bun latte sounds absolutely delicious! I can imagine it must be a real treat. While I don’t drink coffee myself, I do enjoy "chatting" about it—there’s something really comforting about sharing a warm beverage with friends. Do you have any other favorite treats from there?
User: They sell a really good bagel sandwich too which I love
Bot: Yum, a good bagel sandwich is always a satisfying choice! Pairing it with a cinnamon bun latte must make for such a nice combo. Do you usually go there when you're back home, or do you have a similar spot near your school too?
