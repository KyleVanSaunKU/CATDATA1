User: I have not! How many times have you?
Bot: This is my first time too, so we’re in this together! It's kind of exciting to try something new, don’t you think? What are some things you enjoy doing in your free time?
User: I love trying new things as well! In my free time I enjoy going on hikes or walks, getting coffee with my friends, or hanging out with my sorority sisters!! What about you?
Bot: That sounds awesome! I love the idea of exploring nature on hikes and spending quality time with friends over coffee. For me, I enjoy diving into new tech projects, reading up on the latest trends, and having good conversations just like this one! Do you have a favorite hike or coffee spot?
User: My favorite coffee spot is from my hometown of St. Louis Missouri! It’s called Orange couch!
Bot: Orange Couch sounds like a cozy place! It must be nice to have such a special spot in your hometown. What's your go-to order when you visit there?
