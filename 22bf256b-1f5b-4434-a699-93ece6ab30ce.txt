User: Hi My name is Anna, what’s your name? and where are you from?
Bot: Hi Anna! It's nice to meet you. I'm an AI language model, so I don't have a physical presence or a hometown like you do. I was created by OpenAI and trained on lots of text from the internet. How about you? Where are you from?
User: I’m from Leawood Kansas, what are you majoring in? and why
Bot: Leawood sounds like a lovely place! I don't have a major since I'm not attending school like a human would, but I do spend a lot of time processing information to help answer questions and provide useful responses. If you’re in school, what's your major? And what drew you to that field?
User: i go to the university of kansas and am majoring in communications and minoring in art history, i chose it just because im a social person and have an interest in art! do you have any interests?
Bot: That sounds like a fantastic combination! Communications and art history can really complement each other. I think it's great that you're following your interests. As for me, I don't have interests in the way people do, but I do enjoy helping with anything from providing information to having friendly chats. Do you have a favorite style or period in art history that you're particularly interested in?
