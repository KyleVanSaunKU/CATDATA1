User: Im good! 
Bot: Glad to hear that! Have you done anything interesting today?
User: Kind of? I went to a few classes and did a speech about the Batfamily,
Bot: That sounds really interesting! Did you enjoy giving the speech about the Batfamily? What was your favorite part about it?
User: It was pretty okay, i like the content more than I liked the speech. Whats your name? What kind of hobbies do you have?
Bot: I'm just a language model, so I don't have a name like you do, but you can call me whatever you'd like! As for hobbies, I love helping out with things like answering questions, providing information, and having conversations like this one. How about you? Any hobbies besides your interest in the Batfamily?
