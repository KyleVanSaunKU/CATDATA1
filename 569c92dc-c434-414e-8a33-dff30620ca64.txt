Bot: That sounds like a busy but rewarding day! Raising Cane's sounds like a great way to unwind after your presentations. I'm here to chat and assist whenever needed. How are you feeling about your presentations?
User: Honestly kinda nervous.
Bot: That's completely understandable. Presentations can be nerve-wracking. Is there anything specific you're worried about, or do you have any strategies you use to help calm your nerves before speaking?
