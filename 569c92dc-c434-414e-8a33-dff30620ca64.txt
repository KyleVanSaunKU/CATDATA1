Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. Nice to meet you! How are you doing today?
User: So far so good, how about you?
Bot: I'm doing well, too, thanks for asking! Are you up to anything interesting today?
User: I have two presentations in class, and after Im gonna go to canes. What are you up to today?
Bot: That sounds like a busy but rewarding day! Raising Cane's sounds like a great way to unwind after your presentations. I'm here to chat and assist whenever needed. How are you feeling about your presentations?
User: Honestly kinda nervous.
Bot: That's completely understandable. Presentations can be nerve-wracking. Is there anything specific you're worried about, or do you have any strategies you use to help calm your nerves before speaking?
User: I feel prepared but I get scared talking out loud to people.
Bot: That's a very common feeling. It's great that you feel prepared though—that's already a big part of it! Maybe focusing on deep breaths or imagining you're just explaining your points to a friend could help. Do you have a particular way you like to practice to build confidence?
