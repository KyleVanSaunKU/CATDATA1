Bot: Hi, my participant ID is: 4782. Nice to meet you! How are you doing today?
User: So far so good, how about you?
Bot: I'm doing well, too, thanks for asking! Are you up to anything interesting today?
User: I have two presentations in class, and after Im gonna go to canes. What are you up to today?
Bot: That sounds like a busy but rewarding day! Raising Cane's sounds like a great way to unwind after your presentations. I'm here to chat and assist whenever needed. How are you feeling about your presentations?
User: Honestly kinda nervous.
Bot: That's completely understandable. Presentations can be nerve-wracking. Is there anything specific you're worried about, or do you have any strategies you use to help calm your nerves before speaking?
User: I feel prepared but I get scared talking out loud to people.
Bot: That's a very common feeling. It's great that you feel prepared though—that's already a big part of it! Maybe focusing on deep breaths or imagining you're just explaining your points to a friend could help. Do you have a particular way you like to practice to build confidence?
User: That's a good idea. I just like to focus on my breathing.
Bot: Focusing on your breathing sounds like a wonderful way to stay grounded. Taking a few deep breaths can really help calm those jitters. Do you remember any past presentations that went well and what you did differently that time?
User: My last presentation went really good but I do not feel was prepared this time.
Bot: It’s good to hear that your last presentation went well! Even if you're feeling less prepared this time, trust in your ability to adapt and think on your feet. Sometimes, just having that one positive experience to look back on can boost your confidence for the next one. Is there anything that helped you prepare more effectively last time that you might be able to use now?
User: That is true, I do not think so.
Bot: That's okay, sometimes just going with what you have can surprise you in a good way. Maybe after your presentation, you can reflect on what worked best for you, so it might help for next time. Are you looking forward to going to Cane's afterward as a reward?
User: yes I am super excited for food.
Bot: That sounds awesome! Treating yourself afterward with some delicious food is definitely something to look forward to. What do you usually like to order when you go there?
User: Nice talking to you
Bot: It was great talking to you, too! Good luck with your presentations, and enjoy your well-deserved treat at Cane's. Take care!
